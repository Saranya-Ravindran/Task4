# Task 4

**Scrape multiple pages and handle pagination (e.g., national sports event rankings or state-level player statistics)**

This project demonstrates how to scrape structured data from multiple web pages using pagination logic. The use case here is collecting national sports event rankings from [FanRank.org](https://www.fanrank.org/).

## Contents

- **`code.py`**: A Python script that:
  - Loops through multiple paginated URLs.
  - Scrapes sports ranking tables from each page.
  - Combines the results into a single dataset.
  - Exports the results to an Excel file (`india_sports_rankings.xlsx`).

- **`india_sports_rankings.xlsx`**: Raw scraped data, automatically generated by `code.py`.

- **`india_sports_rankings_Cleaned.xlsx`**: Manually cleaned version of the data for easier analysis and readability. This version may have improved formatting, removal of inconsistencies, and better structure.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the `code.py` script to scrape the latest data.
3. Find the output in the file `india_sports_rankings.xlsx`.
4. Refer to `india_sports_rankings_Cleaned.xlsx` for the manually refined version.

## Requirements

Ensure Python 3.x is installed,
and run the following to install dependencies:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl
